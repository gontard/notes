# Throughput vs. Latency

## Network

Latency indicates how long it takes for packets to reach their destination.

Throughput is the term given to the number of packets that are processed within a specific period of time.

Throughput and latency have a direct relationship in the way they work within a network.

## CPU

### Latency

- Each instruction takes a certain time to complete.
- This is the latency for that operation.
- It's the amount of time between when the instruction is issued and when it completes.

### Throughput

- The number of instructions that complete in a span of time.
